# Hey! (Currently Under A Massive Rework!)
Welcome to my personal CV, that I use mainly for applying to hackathons (and maybe jobs in the future??)



The website has three different layouts which are randomly picked upon loading:
```
Hackathons; Where I store all my past projects that I have done, and some of prizes.[Not Done] 
Research; Where I store all the papers and other academic work that I have created. [Done] 
Programming; Where I share my goings-on vis-Ã -vis coding contests and my job(s). [Done] 
```
All the "art" on the website is made by me! If you are interested I can post a link where you can download it, or you can just use inspect element and take it that way...
