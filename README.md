# Hey! (Currently Under A Massive Rework!)
Welcome to my personal CV that I will use for hackathons and maybe to get a job??

The website will have different sections depending on what you ask (will use NLP to find the closest copy):
```
Everything: About + Awards + Hackathons + Research + Outreach

TLDR: About
Bio: About + Awards
Practical Knowlege: About + Awards + Hackathons
Skills: Awards + Hackathons + Research
Awards: Awards
Passions: Hackathons + Outreach
Work/Professional: About + Awards + Outreach
Academic: About + Research
Cool Stuff: Outreach + Hackathons

And More!
```

## Landing Page:

Here is the base of the website, its meant to look like a search bar so that you can ask a question and the website will evolve around that question.. | ![landing](https://github.com/rbrtknwls/rbrtknwls.github.io/blob/master/planning/Home%20Page.png)

### Possible Alternatives (Depends on what was searched)

Will be the landing page when you ask about me, I will make some kind of minimilist art that will slowly fade in, I think this colour will be red! | ![about](https://github.com/rbrtknwls/rbrtknwls.github.io/blob/master/planning/About%20Me.png)

Will be the landing page when you ask about projects, I will make some kind of minimilist art that will slowly fade in, I think this colour will be green! | ![project](https://github.com/rbrtknwls/rbrtknwls.github.io/blob/master/planning/Projects.png)
Will be the landing page when you ask about outreach, I will make some kind of minimilist art that will slowly fade in, I think this colour will be blue! | ![out](https://github.com/rbrtknwls/rbrtknwls.github.io/blob/master/planning/Outreach%20.png)
